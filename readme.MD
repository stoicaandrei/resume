# CV Template

This is a LaTeX template for creating a CV. It is based on the [mcdowellcv](https://github.com/mcdowell/mcdowellcv) template by [Daniil Belyakov](https://github.com/mcdowell).

## Instalation

Mac users
```
brew install texlive-full
```

## Usage

To use this template, you will need to have a LaTeX distribution installed on your computer. You can then open the `template.tex` file in your preferred text editor and start customizing the content.

Once you have finished editing the `template.tex` file, you can compile it to generate a PDF file by running the following command in your terminal:

```
lualatex template.tex
```

This will create a `template.pdf` file in the same directory as the `template.tex` file.

## Customization

You can customize the content of the CV by editing the `template.tex` file.
